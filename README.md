### Hi there 👋 I'm Lorran

I am a Computational Engineer by background and programmer by heart. My passion is building things with innovative and disruptive technologies. This is a reason why I chose to study Blockchain.

Of course, none of this would be possible without a good cup of coffee ☕

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Blockchain Development at [George Brown College](https://www.georgebrown.ca/)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [personal website](https://github.com/LorranSutter/lorransutter.github.io) and in a [multiplayer game](https://github.com/LorranSutter/Dixit) :game_die:
- 💬 Ask me about Life, the Universe and Everything
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorransutter/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know by heart 42 decimal places of the number PI
