![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=LorranSutter.heyPage)

I am a Computational Engineer by background and programmer by heart. My passion is building things with innovative and disruptive technologies. This is a reason why I chose to study Blockchain.

Of course, none of this would be possible without a good cup of coffee â˜•

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Blockchain Developer at [Upstate Intractive](https://upstateinteractive.io/)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working mostly on Ethereum dApps
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Life, the Universe and Everything
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorransutter/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know by heart 42 decimal places of the number PI
